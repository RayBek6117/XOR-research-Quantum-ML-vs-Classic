# XOR-research-Quantum-ML-vs-Classic
Experimental study of XOR classification comparing classical machine learning models (linear, MLP) with a Variational Quantum Classifier. The project analyzes decision boundaries, noise robustness, dataset size effects, and quantum measurement shots under reproducible conditions.
